For 15 years I've spent time learning trades and taken various career paths.  As soon as I started learning JavaScript I was inspired.  What a challenge it was at first, and as soon as things started to click I couldn't stop!  The possibilities in this field are endless, overwhelming at times - but I posess a competetive spirit and love a good challenge.  Primarily I've spent my time learning JavaScript(ES6), React.js, Ruby, Rails, and dabbled with Sinatra and Node.js.  Primarily a Windows user, I also possess skills in MacOS environments and Linux.

Currently I'm learning Redux, and trying to impliment it into a personal project.  I hope to learn as much as I can about React hooks and all the magic they can do for my projects.  If you have any tips, pointers, advice, or you just want to talk about cars and dogs I'm always available via my email and LinkedIn links!  Thanks for stopping by!

### Projects

<strong>jcristmanart</strong> - <a href="https://julianc.tmontobbio.dev" target="_blank">temporary domain</a> | <a href="https://github.com/tmontobbio/julian-cristman-art" target="_blank"/>Repo</a>
</br>This site is currently in production, it is to serve as an art portfolio foir my old friend.  Julian is an incredible artist and he needed a website to get himself out there.  This site is utilizing imgur's API to allow Julian to easily upload his art so it will auto-populate the gallery.  Future plans include, threadless API to act as a store so customers can order any design on a shirt, and  an admin portal so that Julian may log in and change descriptions and his bio.

<strong>tmontobbio.dev</strong> - <a href="https://tmontobbio.dev/" target="_blank">tmontobbio.dev</a> | <a href="https://github.com/tmontobbio/tmontobbio-dev" target="_blank"/>Repo</a>
</br>This project was fun, I put together a personal website to learn more about DNS settings and subdomains.  This site will be the center of my portfolio and all future projects will be here.

<strong>Movie Hunter</strong> - <a href="https://moviehunter.tmontobbio.dev/" target="_blank">moviehunter.tmontobbio.dev</a> | <a href="https://github.com/tmontobbio/movie-hunter" target="_blank"/>Repo</a>
</br>I am a obsessor of film, I watch hundreds of movies a year, I designed this app to keep track of my favorites, and also share those favorites with others.  Users can sign up for an account and create their own list, you can click on users in the user-list and follow them to remember their favorites too!  Go sign up and have fun!

<strong>Dog IM</strong> - <a href="https://dogim.tmontobbio.dev/" target="_blank">dogim.tmontobbio.dev</a> | <a href="https://github.com/tmontobbio/dogim" target="_blank"/>Repo</a>
</br>Dogs are an important part of my life, I chose to theme this app with dogs in mind.  Just a playful chat app where users can create and account, create groups and message others about relevant topics!
